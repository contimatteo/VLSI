  \noindent Very Large Scale Integration problem refers to the trend of integrating circuits into
  silicon chips. In particular, in this report we present the results of four different 
  optimization technique for a specific instance of VLSI set of problems (based on a plate with a 
  fixed width inside which a set of given circuits must be placed). 
  The goal of the objective function is to find the minimum value for the height of the plate.
  The techniques used during the experiments are: Constraint Programming (CP), Proposition 
  Satisfability (SAT), Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP).  
  Despite the use of the same constraints formulation (with respect to the proper optimization 
  technique formalization) we obtained quite differents results over the four techniques. In 
  particular, CP and SAT models out perform the other techinques (SMT, ILP) in terms of number of 
  solved instances.
