\textit{VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration)} refers to the trend of integrating circuits into 
silicon chips. A typical example are systems on a chip for smarthones. The modern trend of shrinking transistor sizes,
allowing engineers to fit more and more transistors into the same area of silicon, has pushed the 
integration of more and more functions of cellphone circuitry into a single silicon die (i.e. 
plate). This enabled the modern cellphone to mature into a powerful tool that shrank from the size 
of a large brick-sized unit to a device small enough to comfortably carry in a pocket or purse, 
with a video camera, touchscreen, and other advanced features. \\

This report describes a Combinatorial Optimization approach to the VLSI problem. In particular, 
four different technologies have been implemented to address the problem at hand, namely Constraint 
Programming (CP), propositional Satisfiability (SAT), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) and 
Linear Programming (LP).
